# Comparative Languages

## Implementing "miniaturized dinnerware" (miniPlait)

In this project, we will be using plait as a metalanguage to implement a small functional programming language called miniPlait.
In essence, miniPlait is a stripped-down version of plait: 
* it is lexically scoped,
* uses eager, call-by-value evaluation
* featuring variables, 
* basic operators, 
* first-class functions, 
* and static types.

In this project, we will be implementing the feeatures above.
The project is subdivided into **five tasks**.

Before we continue, this project is based on the assignments of the course *Fall 2024: Programming Languages* by [Brown university](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2024/).
It is therfore **extremely important** -- foremost, principal, central, _paramount_ even -- that we follow the [testing guidelines](code/testing-guidelines.md) to the letter.

## Getting started

Read the `README`s in each of the task directories under `code/`.
