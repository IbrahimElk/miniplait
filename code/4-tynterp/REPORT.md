# Typed interpreter assignment: Report

By introducing a type-checker, you've eliminated the need for certain runtime checks
and error handling in your `interp` function. We'd like you to reflect on this modification
in a short write-up.

Please answer the following questions with a paragraph each:

1. Which runtime errors are now caught by the initial type-check? Which runtime errors
must still be handled by `interp`?

YOUR ANSWER HERE

2. How has the addition of type-checking changed the semantics of our
overall language? Write three programs that run just fine on your
interpreter from Phase 1, but are no longer valid because they fail
the type checker in Phase 3.

3. How does adding type-checking affect how long it takes to interpret
a program (ignore the time to type-check)? What kinds of programs
might take less ``wall clock'' running time, what kinds might stay the
same, and what kinds might take more?
